#### Device Pinout  
Shield connected with Raspberry Pi only at the next points:     
  43  +5V  
  44  GND  
  37  MOSI  
  34  MISO  
  35  CLK  
  36  CS

Connect the shield to Raspberry Pi which is supplied via a 5V battery (power supply) and connect electrodes.
Full galvanic isolation from mains is required.  
This also applies to the monitor. Use only a monitor that is powered by the Raspberry Pi, as in the picture below, left. Electrodes are positioned according to the International 10-20 system, right
